Description: Provides simple approximations to 'Library Computer Access/Retrieval System' (LCARS) style and appearance to give plots an LCARS theme. 
    This package also includes a collection of functions for generating HTML widgets. 
    These are used with the 'shiny' package to make interactive dashboards with an LCARS theme. 
    More details about LCARS can be found at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCARS>.
