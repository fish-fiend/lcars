## Library Computer Access/Retrieval System ([LCARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCARS))

The `lcars` package provides simple approximations to LCARS style and appearance to give static plots and interactive data analysis an LCARS theme. This splits the package into two areas:

*    One key feature in `lcars` is the ability to wrap ggplot objects in an LCARS-themed border using `lcars_border`.
*    There is also support for an LCARS-themed Shiny UI using `lcarsPage` and related functions.

While the former is fun and useful for nerdy static graphs, the latter is much more exciting because it means you can make something with the look and feel of LCARS that also *actually functions*!

That's right. Make your Shiny app, view it on a touch screen device like your very own Federation issue data PADD, and transport yourself into the future of the Star Trek universe with this 1980s sci-fi television aesthetic!

## Installation

You can install the released version of `lcars` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("lcars")
```

You can install the development version of `lcars` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("leonawicz/lcars")
```

## Example

```{r}
library(lcars)
library(ggplot2)

g <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) + 
  geom_point() + facet_wrap(~Species, 2) + theme_lcars_light()

len_frac <- c(0.3, 0.5, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.3)
n_seg <- c(1, 2, 0, 8)
lcars_border(g, corners = 1:3, length_frac = len_frac, side_n_segments = n_seg)
```

For more examples see the [introduction](articles/lcars.html) vignette.
