## Making a static plot

This examples adds an LCARS-style border around a static plot. Keep in mind that while the `lcars_border` function below takes a ggplot object, the result is not a returnable ggplot object. The function uses the `grid` package underneath the hood and draws the necessary elements using viewports.

```{r ex-1}
library(lcars)
library(ggplot2)
library(grid)
library(png)

logo <- rasterGrob(readPNG(system.file("stlogo-white.png", package = "lcars")))
clrs <- c("firebrick1", "#FFFF33", "lightseagreen")

g <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_lcars_dark() + 
  coord_cartesian(clip = "off") +
  annotation_custom(logo, xmin = 9.4, xmax = Inf, ymin = 3.6, ymax = Inf) +
  scale_color_manual(values = clrs)

len_frac <- c(0.55, 0.25, 0.2, 0.4, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1)
n_seg <- c(1, 2, 0, 8)
corner_colors = c("#CD6363", "#CC99CC", "#FFFF9C", "#FFFF9C")
side_colors <- list("#FFFF9C", c("#99CCFF", "#CC99CC"), NA, 
                    c(rep("#99CCFF", 3), rep("#FF9E63", 5)))
side_labels <- list(
  "R 47.0.2", c("47", "B4"), NA, 
  c("LCARS", "47174-A", "...", "O'Brien", "Lefler", "La Forge", "Barclay", "Argyle"))

lcars_border(g, corners = 1:3, length_frac = len_frac, side_n_segments = n_seg, 
             corner_color = corner_colors, side_color = side_colors, 
             side_label = side_labels, label_size = 0.7)
text(2.8, 0.1, "Iris dataset (classic Terran flora sample)", col = "#99CCFF", font = 2, cex = 0.7)
text(7.55, 0.1, "LCARS BETA R Interface v0.0.1", col = "#FFFF9C", font = 2, cex = 0.7)
```

As you can see, a decent plot is still going to take some customization with additional commands in order to give it the level of polish it deserves.

But this is just the appetizer; next is the Shiny version.

## LCARS in Shiny

In the `lcars` package, functions whose names are lowercase and contain underscores deal with general R use. Functions whose names use camel case are related to Shiny.

First, use `lcarsPage` to set up the Shiny UI. This is a wrapper around Shiny's `bootstrapPage`. It loads the required CSS and other assets.

There are several functions you can explore. There are a handful of simple wrappers around various Shiny inputs that give them an LCARS aesthetic, but not many currently and they will continue to be improved upon in subsequent package versions.

The primary function of interest is `lcarsBox`. This is the container that captures the LCARS style. Additional functions worth focusing on include `lcarsHeader` for breaking up sections of the UI; also `lcarsButton` and `lcarsToggle`, which in conjunction with `buttonColumn` produce column inputs that fit well into the sidebars of an `lcarsBox`.

### Example

Here is a simple example:

```{r ex1, eval=FALSE}
if (interactive()) {

  ui <- lcarsPage(
    lcarsBox(
      fluidRow(
        column(3,
          h4("Main panel area"),
          HTML("<p>Some paragraph text and <a href='#'>a link</a>
          with LCARS styling.</p>
          <p>Use <code>lcarsPage</code>
          to apply the LCARS theme and <code>lcarsBox</code>
          to draw a characteristic box for framing content.</p>
          <p>Many of the <code>lcarsBox</code>
          properties are configurable.
          See <code>lcars::lcarsApp(\"box\")</code> for a demo</p>")
        ),
        column(9, plotOutput("plot1"))
      ),
      title = "box title",
      left_inputs = buttonColumn(lcarsButton("btn1", "A button"))
    )
  )

  server <- function(input, output) {
    output$plot1 <- renderPlot({
      hist(rnorm(500))
    })
  }

  shinyApp(ui, server)
}
```

### Demo apps

Rather than post lots of code here in a non-interactive package vignette, the best suggestion is to explore the example apps included in the package. The source code is easy to browse in the GitHub repository.

Use `lcarsApp` to loads various demo apps:

```{r apps, eval=FALSE}
lcarsApp("demo")
lcarsApp("toggle")
lcarsApp("box")
```

The `box` example is helpful for exploring the many ways you can control the style of an `lcarsBox`. Here are a couple examples highlighting some of the versatility:

#### Corner elbows only

<img src="../man/figures/lcarsBox-ex1.png">

#### Colored segments and input panels

<img src="../man/figures/lcarsBox-ex2.png">

Running these apps will prompt you to install required packages if you do not already have them installed. These are necessary for the examples but not a necessary component of `lcars`, specifically `ggrepel` and `showtext`.

### Recommendations

Pay attention to the arguments to `lcarsPage`. Depending on the nature of text content in your app, you may find you need to deviate from some LCARS-style defaults (e.g., uppercase font) to make the text in your app more pleasant to read.
It will also allow you to revert to sans serif. It is not an all or nothing switch; you have some control over what to change and what to leave alone.

Familiarize yourself with LCARS colors from the `trekcolors` package. This package is a dependency of `lcars`. It includes various other Star Trek color palettes. Most notably it includes a function for previewing the palettes.
